# Numerical Optimization  

 ➡️ Numerical Optimization:

🔻 Objective.

🔸 The aim of this project is to apply different nonlinear numerical optimization methods to solve the Logistic Regression maximum likelihood problem.

🔸 Several numerical algorithms have been programmed, and compared both with each other and with implementations of the Scipy and Sklearn libraries, in terms of computational efficiency and optimality.

 🔻 Developments

️ 🔸 Presentation of the optimization problem present in binary logistic regression.

️ 🔸 Implementation of numerical optimization algorithms: Newton, Quasi-Newtons, Gradient Descent and stochastic versions of each.

️ 🔸 Comparative analysis of the implemented methods as well as solvers of the Scipy and Sklearn frameworks.

️ 🔸 Presentation of the logistic regression problem as an optimization problem with constraints.

️ 🔸 Resolution through a numerical optimization method with penalty.
